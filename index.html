								One of the dolls Rachel received as a gift from her father in Chapter 1. The matryoshka contains dolls of similar shape, but different sizes. The biggest doll represents the mother while the smallest doll represents the seed. During the scene where Rachel obtains this doll from her father, she is stumped as to why her father purchased it in Japan when it is of Russian origin. Her father replied, “I got ‘em in Japan. Japan’s next door to Russia.” (p. 11). This matryoshka could imply Rachel’s future encounter with the Japanese through Kenji and her sister-in-law Etsuko, the adoptive mother of Ruth. This could also represent Rachel as a mother figure. By releasing her daughter, Ruth, from Molokai, Rachel is able to sow the seeds of her next generation, creating her own little matryoshka dolls.

						<div class="boxHeader" id="boxHeader2">Halley's Comet</div>
							<ul>
							<li><a style="cursor:default;">
								Rachel viewed the comet near the end of Chapter 14. This comet caused her to develop an adolescent, yet revelation-like, dream and ultimately quit being a patient of the leprosy research center. This comet is a rare sight to view, only appearing every 75-76 years, and Rachel was able to experience this sight. This fact may imply a symbol of luck for Rachel, as she is one of the few residents of Kalaupapa to have survived with leprosy all the way up to her sixties. This comet could also symbolize Rachel’s desire for beauty, a desire influenced from her distaste in the awful effects of the skin from leprosy. The dream that the comet influenced on Hailey supports this, as after she finished, she replied, “…as if by making this clean man love her she could make herself clean as well, and deny what she was.”

						<div class="boxHeader" id="boxHeader3">Handmade doll </div>
							<ul>
							<li><a style="cursor:default;">
								A homemade doll made from Rachel’s father, who secretly placed it in her belongings before her forced trip to Molokai. The doll seemingly resembles Rachel and has a note attached on it reading, “I love you, Papa”. This handmade doll could symbolize distant bonds. A long distant relationship, whether it may be from a special someone, a best friend, or a family member, is a hard relationship to maintain, especially during Rachel’s era. As the pinned note on the doll indicated that Rachel’s father was responsible for the gift, this could imply that no matter how far she is, her father still loves her. This doll may also serve as a reminder to Rachel her life before the forced exile, a young, cute girl fond of dolls.
